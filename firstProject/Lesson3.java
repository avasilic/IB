		// String methods

		System.out.println(first.length()); // Length is a method so we use ()
		// to call it. It returns the number of characters in the string

		System.out.println(first.toUpperCase()); // Makes all characters
		// uppercase
		System.out.println(first); // This shows that these methods do not
		// mutate the string

		second = second.toLowerCase(); // The value of second is changed here
		System.out.println(second);

		System.out.println(second.substring(2)); // In Java, strings are
		// zero-indexed. Calling substring(2) will, from that position on,
		// return the substring starting from the third character.
		// Zero-indexed means that counting starts from 0. So, n = 0, e = 1, ...

		System.out.println(second.substring(2, 6)); // Returns the substring
		// from the third character to the fifth character. The first one is
		// inclusive. The second is exclusive
		// 2 and 6 are arguments for the method call

		// System.out.println(second.substring()); This will error as we did not
		// provide any arguments

		// The existence of two methods with the same name with a different
		// number of arguments is an example of polymorphism. We can also do
		// polymorphism with types, not just the number of arguments

		// Escape sequences
		System.out.println("Happy\nNew\nYear"); // Everything in quotation marks
		// will be printed except if we have an escape sequence. \n is an escape
		// sequence that will create a new line

		System.out.println(first + "\n" + second); // This will concatenate
		// first with \n, so it will add a new line after printing first

		System.out.println("6\t1001\t33"); // \t is a tab (tabulation). It can
		// help us align values. The output can look like a table

		// System.out.println(""Good morning!""); This is invalid as it sees
		// the first " as the start of a string, the second " as the end of
		// the first string, and then Java will try to look for variables good
		// and morning, which do not exist. If we want to print the " we need to
		// escape it:
		System.out.println("\"Good morning!\"");
		System.out.println("He said \"Good morning!\" to her."); // We can have
		// text before and after the escape
	}
